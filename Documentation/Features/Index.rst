Including Mautic Forms
======================

To include a Mautic form into your TYPO3 frontend, create a new content element. Select the tab "Form elements", then select "Mautic Form".

      :class: with-shadow

You can configure this content element like any other content element. At the bottom of the tab "General" you will find a dropdown list of all the forms
present in Mautic. You can select one, and then save your content element.

Adding this content element to a page will render the Mautic form on the frontend.
