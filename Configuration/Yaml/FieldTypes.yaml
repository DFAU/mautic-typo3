# In this file you can map form field types in TYPO3 to their Mautic equivalent
# Make sure that you include capital letters where needed
# The HasMultipleAnswers means that the field has multiple options in a list
# It DOES NOT mean multiple answers can be selected, that is handled by the field type itself
